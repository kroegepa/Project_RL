TRAINING THE MODEL:
When training the tabular Q-learning agent, you need to run the file main.py as follows:
$ python Project_RL/main.py
It will train and validate the agent and save the Q-table as a .npy file, the rewards to a .csv file and the trajectory information (for plotting) to a .csv file.

TESTING THE MODEL:
Run the file main_testing.py as follows:
$ python Project_RL/main_testing.py --path_data {}
